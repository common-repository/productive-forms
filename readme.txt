Create a page with a URL of your choice and place the Gutenberg block or Elementor widget (shortcode also provided) for a prebuilt design, which can be customized to your taste.

Absolutely. Option exists in both Gutenberg block and Elementor widget to publish either forms only or comprehensive Contact Us pages.
